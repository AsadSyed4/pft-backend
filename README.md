# Product Feedback Tool

A web application for collecting and managing product feedback from clients.

# Project Description

The Product Feedback Tool consists of an API and an admin dashboard. The application allows both clients and administrators to interact with feedback entries. Seeders have been created for clients, feedbacks, and comments, making it easy to set up the initial data.

# Usage

## For Clients
Clients can log in and provide feedback on products, including details such as the feedback title, description, and category (e.g., bug report, feature request, improvement, etc.).

## For Administrators
Administrators can manage feedback entries and comments. They have access to a dashboard where they can view, edit, and delete feedback entries. Additionally, administrators can review and moderate comments related to feedback.

# Technologies
Laravel: The PHP framework used for building the API and admin dashboard.
Vue.js: The JavaScript framework for creating interactive web interfaces.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.
Inertia.js: A library for building server-driven single-page apps.
